        <h3>What is Computer Engineering?</h3>
        <p>Computer Science Engineering is an integrated field of engineering that combines aspects of Electronic
            Engineering with Computer Sciences. It is mainly bifurcated into two parts â€“ Hardware Engineering and
            Software Engineering. As the name reflects, Hardware Engineering is all about constructing a small microchip
            for large scientific computers. Software Engineering covers designing and constructing software for various
            purposes.
            It is not easy to define Computer Engineering in a statement due to the extensive nature of this field.
            Computer engineers undertake various responsibilities depending on the industry and their place of
            employment, ranging from the manufacturing of microprocessors to creating and designing computer programs
            and algorithms.
